Hey Jonathon,

I just wanted to let you know that you mean so much to me and I'm so glad to have you in my life. I don't know if you'e feeling stressed, anxious, fearful, unfocused, burned out or maybe another emotion, but I'm here to tell you that you WILL get through this. You are one of the most hard working, determined, compassionate people I've ever met (and the list goes on!!) I know that this moment may seem so hard, the task or goal may seem impossible, but I know full hearedly that you are going to make through. You're fighting for you. Im fighting for you. And more importantly, Jesus is fighting for you. ALways. Take a moment to breathe, listen to yourself and your needs, talk to God! Hopefully that will make you feel a little bit better. You know that you can calle me or text me anytime - and if you're reading this I think you should! I'd love to support you in any wy that I can. Remember - you are SOO capable and SO loved. You got this J.

Love,
Kaleigh ANNE Blouin
